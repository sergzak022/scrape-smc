Functions of the organ systems are included at the introductory level to prepare students for a course in Human Physiology.  Laboratory assignments develop the skills of observation, investigation, identification, discovery and dissection.  The use of actual specimens, including cat dissection and observation of a human cadaver, is emphasized to assure that students learn the relative structure, functions, textures and variations in tissues not incorporated in models.  Supplemental materials such as models, photographs, charts, videotapes, and digitized images are also provided.  This course is required for students preparing for many Allied Health professions including, but not limited to, Nursing, Respiratory Therapy, Physical Therapy, Physical Education and Kinesiology Training, and Physician's Assistant and is a prerequisite for Human Physiology 3.</address></p></td></tr>

Immigration, enculturation, acculturation, religion, food availability, food preference, food behavior, food preparation, food beliefs and food-related gender roles are considered. These factors are compared and contrasted across the ethnic groups and regions in America. The impact of "Americanization" on ethnic cuisines and impact of ethnic cuisines on the American economy are explored. Current research on the health- and nutrition-related implications of ethnic groups' food choices/practices is reviewed.

Supplemental Instruction (SI) is an academic assistance program that utilizes free peer-assisted weekly study sessions to help students learn the most difficult course content. For more information, please see the SI website at www.smc.edu/si.</address></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="4"><p><address>This course will focus on the theory and application of psychological principles as they relate to the causes of, and potential solutions to, current global environmental problems. Modern ecological issues (such as global climate change, habitat-loss, etc.) have their historical origin in human behavior; this class will focus both on relevant causal behaviors, and on the mental mechanisms that give rise to such behavior. An evolutionary perspective will be employed to identify the pathways by which the clash of a ¿universal human nature¿ and the modern environment results in an ¿evolutionary mismatch.¿ Evolutionary models such as the ¿tragedy of the commons¿ will be elucidated with relevant and real world examples. In addition, the course will explore potential avenues to effectively reshape human kind¿s social, technological and economic relationship with its environment. As such, a systems approach will be taken that considers the human as a part of, as well as an influence on, ecosystems. Cutting edge research will be integrated from different domains of psychology (cognitive, social, developmental and evolutionary, etc.) as well as related fields (genetics, behavioral economics, game-theory, anthropology, etc.) to comprehensively study the human-environment interaction.</address></p></td></tr>

In addition the course considers how social practices are shaped by and shape language use, as well as how language is acquired and learned. The course provides a grounding in linguistics as a field of study, basic analytic skills for viewing and discussing language from a variety of perspectives, and greater awareness of the relevance of language across and within cultures.</address></p></td></tr>

Modern ecological issues (such as global climate change, habitat-loss, etc.) have their historical origin in human behavior; this class will focus both on relevant causal behaviors, and on the mental mechanisms that give rise to such behavior. An evolutionary perspective will be employed to identify the pathways by which the clash of a "universal human nature" and the modern environment results in an "evolutionary mismatch."  Evolutionary models such as the "tragedy of the commons" will be elucidated with relevant and real world examples. In addition, the course will explore potential avenues to effectively reshape human kind's social, technological and economic relationship with its environment. As such, a systems approach will be taken that considers the human as a part of, as well as an influence on, ecosystems. Cutting edge research will be integrated from different domains of psychology (cognitive, social, developmental and evolutionary, etc.) as well as related fields (genetics, behavioral economics, game-theory, anthropology, etc.) to comprehensively study the human-environment interaction.</address></p></td></tr>

Cities are examined both as complex social-economic groupings of people, and as material landscapes of buildings, pathways, and public and private spaces. Attention is paid to what cities are and have been (the evolving urban experience of the past and present) as well as to ever-changing ideas about what cities should be (urban planning and design for the future). While the overall perspective of the course is global, its primary focus is on the cities of North America and, in particular, the Los Angeles metropolitan area. This emphasis is evident both in the classroom and in field trips or other assignments that ask students to apply classroom ideas to our local urban setting.</address></p></td></tr>

Utilizing the methods and tools found in the interdisciplinary field of women's studies, the course is rooted in theoretically-based and thoughtfully-organized individual and collective action through leadership training, group activities, service-learning, and networking opportunities both on and off campus. By emphasizing the importance of praxis--connecting theory and practice--students develop an understanding of a broad range of women's experiences across class, racial/ethnic, and international lines. Students initiate, design, and implement a "field project" of their choosing that demonstrates their understanding of feminist theories and praxis.
